            The Millennium Project (think tank) is a global foresight project that anticipates building a better future by improving humanity’s prospects. The Millennium Project assumes that the world needs to think seriously about these challenges now, because it may take a generation or more to make the changes necessary to improve our future prospects. To address this challenge, they launched a Future Work/Technology 2050 study with eight steps. Precisely, they created the Real-Time Delphi International Survey where well-versed professionals in their fields gave their opinions about diverse technologies and their impact in projected-view time periods and future impact on jobs.
Participants responded to ten questions as part of ‘Future Work/Technology 2050 Real-Time Delphi Study’. We studied diverse opinions on technology impact and distributions with well-elaborated visualizations that give a clear view of how exactly these experts see the world 2020-2050 in regards to unemployment.

Participants of low, medium, and high experience also foresee an increase in unemployment from 2020 to 2050. What is particularly interesting is that higher experience participants foresee a higher increase in employment as compared to medium and low experience participants. Also, Futurists see a higher unemployment in future than the Non-Futurists.<br />

Experts used words such as “human” “AI”, “new”, “technology”, “Jobs”, “Social”, and “National” more often. Overall, experts across the world were open to accept these future technologies in the belief that jobs will be created and people will be progressive. There are two additional word clouds, the first for question 5.1 - The main insight derived from the visualization is that people are considering issues such as demand for materials, consumption, food, and wealth created by technologies as important in deciding the impact on cost living. From the second additional word cloud on question 8.2, it can be understood that responders perceive that the benefits of AI must be distributed equally to 
            all classes in order to fulfill basic needs, such as education, food, and shelter. Second, words such as “redistribute”, ”share”, and ”equal”, reinstate that the distribution would initially cause a gap between the different levels in society and thus the wealth must be redistributed to all. The next levels benefits must be shared such that there is good infrastructure, access to resources, improved working conditions, pay, and health. Some of the key challenges are the direction to take from this information, and there are many avenues to further explore this data.

    <strong>A.	Co-occurrence Network:</strong> 
The topic similarity of basic and
aggregate units of science can be calculated via an analysis of the co-occurrence of words in associated texts. Units that share more words in common are assumed to have higher topical overlap and are connected via linkages and/or placed in closer proximity. Word co-occurrence networks are weighted and undirected. (Source: <a href="http://wiki.cns.iu.edu">http://wiki.cns.iu.edu</a>)

    <strong>B.	Real Time Delphi data / RTD:</strong>
The Real-Time Delphi is a relatively new and efficient method for collecting and synthesizing expert opinions. The original Delphi technique was developed by the RAND Corporation in the late 1950s. Although it has produced many valuable insights for many around the world, it requires multiple rounds of questionnaires that can take months to complete. The big advantage of the RTD is that it is a “roundless” Delphi. There is no need for an explicit second round. The respondents participate by filling out an online questionnaire, and the results––both numerical and qualitative––are updated as responses are recorded in “real time.” Respondents can––and are encouraged to––revisit the questionnaire as many times as they want. Each time, they are shown their own responses as well as the updated answers of the others, and they can revise and change their own inputs based on this feedback.

    <strong>C.	Word Cloud:</strong>
A word cloud is a popular visualization of words typically associated with Internet keywords and text data. They are most commonly used to highlight popular or trending terms based on frequency of use and prominence. A word cloud is a beautiful, informative image that communicates much in a single glance.

    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>D.	Temporal Analysis:</strong>
Temporal analysis aims to identify the nature of phenomena represented by a sequence of observations such as patterns, trends, seasonality, outliers, and bursts of activity.
A time series is a sequence of events or observations that are ordered in time. Time-series data can be continuous (i.e., there is an observation at every instant of time) or discrete (i.e., observations exist for regularly or irregularly spaced intervals). Temporal aggregations – over journal volumes, years, or decades – are common.
Frequently, some form of filtering is applied to reduce noise and make patterns more salient. Smoothing (i.e., averaging using a smoothing window of a certain width) and curve approximation might be applied. The number of scholarly records is often plotted to get a first idea of the temporal distribution of a dataset. It might be shown in total values or as a percentage of those. One may find out how long a scholarly entity was active; how old it was at a certain point; what growth, latency to peak, or decay rate it has; what correlations with other time series exist; or what trends are observable. Data models such as the least squares model – available in most statistical software packages – are applied to best fit a selected function to a data set and to determine if the trend is significant. Kleinburg's burst detection algorithm is commonly applied to identify words that have experienced a sudden change in frequency of occurrence.

    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>E.	Topical Analysis:</strong>
Topical analysis extracts the set of unique words or word profiles and their frequency from a text corpus. Stop words, such as 'the' and 'of' are removed. Stemming can be applied. Co-word analysis identifies the number of times two words are used in the title, keyword set, abstract and/or full text of a paper. The space of co-occurring words can be mapped providing a unique view of the topic coverage of a dataset. Similarly, units of science can be grouped according to the number of words they have in common.
Salton's term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a corpus. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the paper but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.
Dimensionality reduction techniques are commonly used to project high-dimensional information spaces (i.e., the matrix of all unique papers multiplied by their unique terms, in a low, typically two-dimensional space). (Source: <a href="http://wiki.cns.iu.edu">http://wiki.cns.iu.edu</a>)
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>F.	Geospatial Analysis:</strong>
Geospatial analysis has a long history in geography and cartography. Geospatial analysis aims to answer the question of where something happens and what impact that something has on neighboring areas.
Geospatial analysis requires spatial attribute values or geolocations for authors and their papers, extracted from affiliation data or spatial positions of nodes, generated from layout algorithms. Geospatial data can be continuous (i.e., each record has a specific position) or discrete (i.e., each set of keywords has a position or area-shape file – e.g., number of papers per country). Spatial aggregations (e.g., merging via ZIP codes, counties, states, countries, and continents) are common.
Cartographic generalization refers to the process of abstraction such as (1) graphic generalization: the simplification, enlargement, displacement, merging, or selection of entities without enhancing their symbology; and (2) conceptual symbolization: the merging, selection, and symbolization of entities, including enhancement – such as representing high-density areas with a new (city) symbol.
Geometric generalization aims to solve the conflict between the number of visualized features, the size of symbols, and the size of the display surface. Cartographers dealt with this conflict intuitively in part until researchers like Friedrich Töpfer attempted to solve them with quantifiable expressions.
